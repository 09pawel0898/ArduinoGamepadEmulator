/*
* 
* A program for emulating keyboard or mouse by interacting with componnents connected to Arduino.
* It tracks the messages sent via serial port from arduino, recognizes and handle them properly.
* Its very easily to set up a bunch of components connected to your arduino like buttons, switches, joystick
* and then to assign actions to them.
* The biggest disadvantage is a requirement to have it running in the background of the game..
